  Welcome! This will be the premiere place to learn about the latest shenanigans of the OSEM team.
  Explore with us the world of Free and Open Source Event management. Learn about the latest releases, features and issues of 
  our little app. Let's go on a wild Ruby on Rails tour. Let's stage-dive into the latest, hot frontend topics together.
  C'mon people, let's rock 'n' roll!

<h2>Gearing up for 1.0</h2>
<p>
  Currently we're not only busy buying socks and ties :gift: for our loved ones, Christmas :christmas_tree: is around the corner, 
  the whole team is also working hard to get the first official release out of the door. There are only two ship stoppers left, one in
  our own code regarding <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/567">association dependencies</a> and the other one in
  <a href="https://github.com/ankane/ahoy/issues/32">ahoy</a>, the ruby gem we use to track visits. Particular the latter is a nasty 
  little bugger involving non-integer primary keys in rails, which seems to be :shit: you just don't want to encounter.
</p>

<p>
  Once we squashed these we should be able to let the big :one: go! :dash: OSEM 1.0 will be the culmination of more than <strong>1.000</strong>
  commits to :octocat:. It will be a release which already has powered <strong>5</strong> large FOSS conferences. More
  than <strong>1000</strong> people have gone through the registration and around <strong>300</strong> lectures through the paper
  submission work flow. It has proven to be an asset in the tool belt of major :neckbeard: Free and Open Source Software
  communities, :kiss: to openSUSE, GNOME and ownCloud!
</p>

  Besides diligently submitting code to our repository we also went ahead and bought the <a href="http://osem.io">osem.io</a> domain
  and hacked up this page to be able to release OSEM 1.0 with the :boom: <em>brag factor</em> :boom: it deserves!
  As we take our freedom seriously also this endeavor is purely based on Free and Open Source Software. <em>osem.io</em> is built using
  the wonderful static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the frontend is developed in the awesome
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> framework from twitter (same as OSEM itself) and it's look is based on the neat
  <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">agency theme</a> from StartBootstrap.com. Standing on shoulders of others
  is fun :balloon: Imagine you would have to come up with all of this :shit: by yourself, just to publish a web page. :scream_cat: :sob: :skull:
</p>

<h3>Stay tuned</h3>
<p>
  That's whats currently going on with the OSEM crowd. We hope you enjoyed this first post and that you'll come back for more. If you
  have anything to say, just leave a comment would you?
</p>
<p>
  We're looking forward to the release and more posts, like all the little ones :baby: look forward to the next days :christmas_tree: See you around!
